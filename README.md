# Google Spreadsheet Publisher

This app was originally conceived as an intermediary application to communicate the ESP32 microcontroller of [this repo](https://github.com/jose-azevedo/photovoltaic-systems-monitor) with Google APIs. It is hosted on Heroku and accepts HTTP requests containing the name of a file and the data to be stored on a spreadsheet.
